Just another repo!

Hi Everyone!

A little bit about myself - From the day I learned what a computer was, I have been facinated with them since. For reasons I will spare details on, I never persued my interest and started my career in the "blue collar" industries. This path continued until 2020 when covid-19 disrupted the paths of many, some negatively and some positively. Luckily, I have been positively affected in that, I was forced to explore other means of income, think outside the box and developed an entire, brand new plan for which I wanted my life to go, not where "the Man" told me I would go. I have set out on a mission to learn how to write code, incorporating Blockchain Technology to do my part in helping the world become a better place in which we ALL have the same access to the tools needed in order to create anything without being limited by geography or governments lacking the best intrest of it's people.
